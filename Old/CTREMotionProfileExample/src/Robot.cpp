/**
 * This C++ FRC robot application is meant to demonstrate an example using the Motion Profile control mode
 * in Talon SRX.  The CANTalon class gives us the ability to buffer up trajectory points and execute them
 * as the roboRIO streams them into the Talon SRX.
 * 
 * There are many valid ways to use this feature and this example does not sufficiently demonstrate every possible
 * method.  Motion Profile streaming can be as complex as the developer needs it to be for advanced applications,
 * or it can be used in a simple fashion for fire-and-forget actions that require precise timing.
 * 
 * This application is an IterativeRobot project to demonstrate a minimal implementation not requiring the command 
 * framework, however these code excerpts could be moved into a command-based project.
 * 
 * The project also includes instrumentation.java which simply has debug printfs, and a MotionProfile.java which is generated
 * in @link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PgT10EeQiR92LNXEOEe3VGn737P7WDP4t0CQxQgC8k0/edit#gid=1813770630&vpid=A1
 * 
 * Logitech Gamepad mapping, use left y axis to drive Talon normally.  
 * Press and hold top-left-shoulder-button5 to put Talon into motion profile control mode.
 * This will start sending Motion Profile to Talon while Talon is neutral. 
 * 
 * While holding top-left-shoulder-button5, tap top-right-shoulder-button6.
 * This will signal Talon to fire MP.  When MP is done, Talon will "hold" the last setpoint position
 * and wait for another button6 press to fire again.
 * 
 * Release button5 to allow OpenVoltage control with left y axis.
